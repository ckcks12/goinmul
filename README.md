### What deos it do

Haven't you ever thought that submitting your code by *WEB* is quite **annoying**?

Yeah, I think I already told ya why I made this :)

### Guide

1. First, install this extension on your visual studio code.
2. Then open the palette(`ctrl+shift+p`) and type `preference`.
3. In the Preference tab, filter by typing `goinmul`. All configurations are there.

### Baekjoon 백준 usage

There are two commands available.

1. Login 로그인
2. Submit 제출

`Submit` will submit your code that is now edited on your visual studio code.

If you ain't logged in, it wil do that for you hahahaha.

And then it asks you of what problem number you gonna submit.

Don't worry, once you input the number, it would be saved automatically.

### How many web sites deos it support?
